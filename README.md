# Pyliament
An MMP parliament simulator using Matplotlib and other modules.

You'll need python to run this, as well as `yaml` (`pip install pyyaml`).
Plots are generated based on polpoints.txt, with random political parties that can split and merge.

To see the next generation, close the current plot and hit enter in the console, which will run voting, splitting, merging, all that and display the next generation as another plot. You may keep closing and hitting enter for as long as you like.
